C:
Petroleum Engineering Building Elevator
- the key switches are odd, I don’t think I’ve ever seen an elevator with key switches before
- some of the key switches are with the buttons and some are high above them which seems disorganized
- it would be better to have all the key switches separate from the main buttons to keep it simpler and less confusing

B:
- Common uses include: going to a floor, force closing the door, and holding the door open
- Rare uses include: sounding the emergency alarm and using the phone
- The existing interface makes all of these things easy, the switches are just distracting and in the way
- Most common sequence of actions is probably just walking in and pressing a floor button then exiting the elevator
- The design is simple, the user should be able to figure it out
- The buttons light up when pressed
- Maybe misidentifying the switches as buttons, but this is unlikely
- I would suggest moving the switches to a separate area from the control buttons
